INTRODUCTION
This is a implementation of the greed algorithm in python.
It is really simple. Given a city it found the next one
by distance. The closest one is the next city in the TSP path.

It only suports TSP problems and EDGE_WEIGHT_TYPE of EUC_2D.
But you can customize the code and create any graph example you want.

IF you want to customize the code READ README_ACO.txt
